# Data-Wrangling-using-Excel
## Introduction
A #datacleaningchallenge was organized recently in the data tech space which gave newbies and intermediate learners the opportunity to work on a data cleaning project.
The challenge encouraged every participant to flex their data cleaning skill using any of their preferred tool (e.g, Powerquery, Excel, Python, R, SQL, Google sheets).

The FIFA21 dataset in its messy form was gotten from kaggle and contains 18980 rows and 76 columns, which include information such as the player name, playerUrl, LongName, photoUrl, Nationality, BOV, club, Age, POT, OVA, Contract, Positions, Height, Weight, Preferred foot, Best Position etc. 
The dataset was in a structured format with each playerâ€™s information occupying a row in the dataset. The data file also includes the data dictionary whhich can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Darexboy/Data-Wrangling-using-Excel/blob/main/FIFA%20Dataset%20Dictionary.pptx)
